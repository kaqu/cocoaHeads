/*:
 
 ## Pros
 - Pattern matching is cool, just cool ðŸ˜Ž
 - It can verbose your intention
 - It can save you a lot of time and typing
 - It allows you to organize things better (enums)
 - It allows to keep code relatively clean and compact
 - It allows a nice way of dealing with dynamic or string based API
 
 ## Cons
 - It can be really messy if used wild
 - There are still some bugs in swift
 - Custom patterns may cause performance problems that are not obvious (i.e. regex)
 
 
 Defensive programming tip:
 You should use switch instead of if statements, it forces you to think about each path.
