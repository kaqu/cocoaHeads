Playground from talk:

* Kacper Kaliński from Miquido: "Pattern matching in Swift"

Pattern matching is a useful tool to make your code better and more expressive. It is well documented and quite old concept but slightly unused in Swift. I will show you some use cases which you probably not tried before

## Usage

Just open playground and enable rendered markup in Xcode: Editor -> Show rendered markup -> Enjoy!
Rendered markup contains navigation buttons which allows you to navigate through pages and content.
